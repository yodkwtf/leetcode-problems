# LeetCode Problem Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems, with each problem being contained in its own folder. The folder contains the problem statement and the solution(s) to the problem in a programming language of choice. Additionally, a README file is included in each folder with the following information:

- Problem statement and constraints
- Explanation of the approach used to solve the problem
- Time and space complexity of the solution

## Structure of the Repository

Each LeetCode problem is contained in its own folder, with the folder name being the LeetCode problem number and title. The folder structure is as follows:

```sh
LeetCode Problem Number and Title/
├── NOTES.md
├── solution.ext
└── README.md
```

- `NOTES.md` - contains an explanation of the approach used to solve the problem and the time and space complexity of the solution
- `solution.ext` - contains the solution to the problem in a programming language of choice (e.g. `solution.py`, `solution.java`, `solution.js`)
- `README.md` - contains the problem statement and constraints
